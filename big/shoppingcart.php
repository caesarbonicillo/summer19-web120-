Customer service is the hallmark of their business, but how can that translate to online. In 1998 they had forayed into the online, selling both in brick and mortar, as well as online.

	One metric is shopping cart measuring how long an item sits in their visitor’s shopping cart. Do they buy it immediately or do they wait till it goes on sale. This can tell a business what items are marketed to whom and what are the spending habits of that person and others that have that same item in their cart. A feature of that can be attached to this is an email reminder for items left in their shopping cart reminding those that agreed to email correspondence, that they have “hot items” waiting to be bought.
