“A picture is worth a thousand words” a quote that has illustrates how important and how quickly one can judge whatever you’re trying to convey. So when a client has an important message to say, no matter how well it is articulated in one single instance, the matter in which it is displayed, formatted, and navigated, can be judged and discarded in mere seconds.

	According to Nielson Norman Group, a leader in researched based User Experience, the average viewer spends less than a minute reading through a webpage, and in fact most will leave within the first 10 seconds. If your client’s site is based upon shopping, or exhibiting photography and not a research or informational based website then the way their images are displayed play an integral part of the website. 
</p>

<p class = "para">
So before you begin to build a client webpage think about how and on what platform your users will be viewing the page. Will it be a desktop? Perhaps a tablet? Or maybe the versatile mobile phone. I side with the notion that your viewers will first judge your website on a mobile phone. Smart Insights writes that viewers spend 2x more time on their phones than their desktops on the web. Taking this into account building galleries specifically for mobile before desktop narrows down and puts into focus what’s most important and can lead to repeat viewers on desktop.

RoyalSlider is a very solid choice when choosing a type of display. A highlight that RoyalSlider has is that it is Search Engine Optimized (SEO) pushing your page further to the front of the searches, an important and overlooked feature. It is a JQuery plugin, with animations and responsive touch for mobile devices. Use it as an image slider, content slider, gallery, or presentation.

Another great is JSSor which is a touch/swipe selector, which freezes the image when touched. There is no clumsy animations and can be navigated as quickly or as slowly as the viewer wishes. It also has over 360 different effects.

    <p class = "para">
	Whatever type of gallery your client chooses make sure it conveys the message you are wanting to give them and is as glitch-free and intuitive as possible for the best user experience a visitor to the site can receive.
